# The Only Thing To Do

There is nothing you need to do to use this plugin. Simply activate it.

There is one filter you can use to modify the user meta values you want to hijack. Simply feed the `ac_user_metas` filter with an array of key value pairs.

The default options being set are:

```
		$metas = array(
			'admin_color'		=> 'fresh',
			'comment_shortcuts'	=> true,
			'use_ssl'			=> 0,
			'aim'				=> '',
			'yim'				=> '',
			'jabber'			=> '',
			'googleplus'		=> '',
			'primary_blog'		=> '1',
			'nickname'			=> ''
		);
```
